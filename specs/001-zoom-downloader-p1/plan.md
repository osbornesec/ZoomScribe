# Implementation Plan: Zoom Cloud Recording Downloader

**Branch**: `001-zoom-downloader-p1` | **Date**: 2025-09-28 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/michael/dev/ZoomScribe/specs/001-zoom-downloader-p1/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
A command-line tool to download Zoom cloud recordings based on specified filters. The technical approach is to build a Python CLI application using the `requests` library for API communication and `click` for the user interface.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+
**Primary Dependencies**: `requests`, `click`, `pytest`
**Storage**: Filesystem
**Testing**: `pytest`
**Target Platform**: CLI (Linux, macOS, Windows)
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: N/A for this phase.
**Constraints**: Must handle Zoom API rate limits gracefully.
**Scale/Scope**: Phase 1 is limited to listing and downloading recordings.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **Spec & Plan**: The feature spec lists user-visible behavior, acceptance criteria, and edge cases. The plan enumerates risks and applies the Security Standard.
- [x] **Tests**: Unit, integration, regression, and negative tests are planned for all new logic and I/O boundaries.
- [x] **Static Analysis & Types**: The plan accounts for passing lint, formatting, and strict type-checking.
- [x] **Security**: The plan addresses secret management (via `.env` file), vulnerability scanning, data auditing, and input validation.
- [x] **Git & Review**: The plan uses standard branching and commit conventions.
- [x] **Observability**: The plan includes tasks for structured logging, metrics, and tracing.
- [x] **Documentation**: The plan includes tasks for updating READMEs, docstrings, or other documentation.

**Structure Decision**: A single-project structure is appropriate for this CLI tool. The source code will reside in `src/zoom_scribe` and tests in `src/tests`.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
*Completed. See `research.md`.*

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Completed. See `data-model.md` and `quickstart.md`. No API contracts are needed for this CLI tool.*

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base.
- Generate tasks based on the Python project structure defined above.
- Create tasks for:
  - Setting up the Python virtual environment and installing dependencies.
  - Implementing the Zoom API client in `client.py`.
  - Implementing the data models in `models.py`.
  - Implementing the file download logic in `downloader.py`.
  - Building the CLI interface in `main.py` using `click`.
  - Writing unit and integration tests for each module in the `tests/` directory.

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation.
- Dependency order: Models → Client → Downloader → Main.

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in `tasks.md`.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented
