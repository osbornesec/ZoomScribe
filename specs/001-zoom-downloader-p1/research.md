# Research: Zoom Cloud Recording Downloader

## Technology Stack Selection

- **Decision**: Use Python 3.11+ with the `requests`, `click`, and `pytest` libraries.
- **Rationale**: The feature is a command-line tool for automating API interactions and file downloads. Python is an excellent fit due to its strong ecosystem for this purpose. This choice aligns with the constitution's principle of favoring simple, maintainable, and proven solutions.
  - `requests`: A robust and easy-to-use library for making HTTP requests to the Zoom API.
  - `click`: A modern and composable library for creating a clean and user-friendly command-line interface (CLI).
  - `pytest`: A powerful and scalable testing framework for ensuring the tool's reliability and correctness.
- **Alternatives considered**: 
  - **Shell Script (Bash/Zsh)**: While possible, handling complex API logic, pagination, retries, and JSON parsing would be cumbersome and less maintainable.
  - **Node.js**: A viable alternative, but Python's straightforward syntax for scripting and data handling makes it a slightly better fit for this specific task.
