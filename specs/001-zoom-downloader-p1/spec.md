# Feature Specification: Zoom Cloud Recording Downloader ‚Äî Phase 1

**Feature Branch**: `feat/zoom-downloader-p1`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Zoom Cloud Recording Downloader ‚Äî Phase 1 (download only) WHAT & WHY Build a small, reliable tool that downloads Zoom **cloud recordings** for the authorized account so we can back them up and process them offline. This first phase focuses only on listing and downloading recordings (no UI, no editing, no transcripts). It must be resilient, secure, and easy to run on a schedule. SCOPE (Phase 1) - Let me fetch recordings by: - time range: YYYY‚ÄëMM‚ÄëDD ‚Üí YYYY‚ÄëMM‚ÄëDD (default: last 30 days) - optional host filter (email) OR meeting ID/UUID when I know it - List recordings and download each selected `recording_file` to a target directory on disk using a clean path scheme: `{host_email}/{YYYY}/{MM}/{DD}/{meeting_topic}-{meeting_uuid}/{file_type}-{start_time}.{ext}` - Respect Zoom‚Äôs API behavior: - ‚ÄúList recordings for a user‚Äù for the authorized user (`/users/me/recordings`) or account‚Äëwide listing when we have admin scopes (Phase 1 should support either). - If given a meeting ID (not UUID), only the **latest** instance‚Äôs recordings are returned; to fetch other instances, enumerate `/past_meetings/{meetingId}/instances` and then call `/meetings/{uuid}/recordings` for each. - If a meeting UUID begins with ‚Äú/‚Äù or contains ‚Äú//‚Äù, **double‚ÄëURL‚Äëencode** it when used in path params. - To download a file, use the `recording_files[].download_url`. Handle passcode‚Äëprotected or restricted downloads by appending the OAuth **access token** as `?access_token=...` or use `download_access_token` when available. - Support `include_fields=download_access_token&ttl=<seconds>` when calling `/meetings/{id|uuid}/recordings` so downloads can work without interactive passcode prompts. - Pagination & limits: - Implement pagination (`page_size`, `next_page_token`) and graceful handling of HTTP 429 (per‚Äësecond or daily) with backoff and retry. - Security & Ops: - Use OAuth 2.0. Prefer **Server‚Äëto‚ÄëServer OAuth** for account‚Äëwide use; JWT is deprecated. Never log tokens or embed them in files or URLs we store. - Honor org settings that may restrict downloads (e.g., ‚Äúonly host can download‚Äù); surface a clear error when policy prevents download. - Provide a dry‚Äërun mode that lists exactly what would be downloaded. - Provide idempotency: skip files that already exist unless `--overwrite` is set. - Out of scope for Phase 1: deletion, S3 uploads, transcripts/CC parsing, thumbnails, share‚Äëlink management, or UI. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA - Given valid OAuth credentials and a time range with at least one cloud recording, running the tool: - Lists found meetings and the number of `recording_files` detected. - Downloads MP4/M4A/VTT/TXT `recording_files` to the target directory using the naming scheme above. - Handles a passcode‚Äëprotected recording by successfully downloading it using the access token (or `download_access_token` when requested). - Demonstrates correct handling of pagination (>= 50 files) and a simulated 429 by backing off and succeeding on retry. - Demonstrates correct handling of a UUID that requires **double‚Äëencoding**. - Produces logs without secrets and exits non‚Äëzero on any skipped download due to permissions, with actionable messages. NON‚ÄëNEGOTIABLES - Follow the project constitution‚Äôs quality gates for tests, linting, types, and security. - No stack choice is implied here; choose a simple, maintainable approach. Keep diffs small and reversible. FUTURE PHASES (not now) - Push to S3 with server‚Äëside encryption, retention tags. - Automatic transcript and chat extraction. - Policy‚Äëdriven cleanup/archiving."

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: How should the tool handle a `meeting_topic` that contains characters that are invalid for a directory or file name (e.g., `/`, `\`, `?`)? ‚Üí A: Sanitize the topic by replacing all invalid characters with an underscore (`_`).
- Q: What is the retry policy for API failures like HTTP 429 (rate limiting)? ‚Üí A: A fixed number of retries (e.g., 3) with exponential backoff.
- Q: If the specified target directory for downloads does not exist, how should the tool behave? ‚Üí A: Automatically create the entire directory path.
- Q: If the OAuth 2.0 access token is invalid or expired during an API call, how should the tool respond? ‚Üí A: Prompt the user for new credentials.
- Q: If a download of a `recording_file` fails for reasons other than permissions (e.g., network error, file corruption), how should the tool behave? ‚Üí A: Retry the download a fixed number of times (e.g., 3) before failing.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Build a small, reliable tool that downloads Zoom cloud recordings for the authorized account so we can back them up and process them offline. This first phase focuses only on listing and downloading recordings. It must be resilient, secure, and easy to run on a schedule.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** valid OAuth credentials and a time range with at least one cloud recording, **When** the tool is run, **Then** it lists the found meetings and the number of `recording_files` detected.
2.  **Given** the tool has listed recordings, **When** the download process is initiated, **Then** it downloads all MP4, M4A, VTT, and TXT `recording_files` to the target directory using the specified naming scheme.
3.  **Given** a recording is passcode-protected, **When** the tool attempts to download it, **Then** it successfully downloads the file by using the `access_token` or `download_access_token`.
4.  **Given** an API response contains more results than the page size (e.g., >50), **When** the tool processes the response, **Then** it correctly handles pagination to retrieve all recordings.
5.  **Given** the Zoom API returns an HTTP 429 (rate limit) error, **When** the tool receives the error, **Then** it backs off exponentially before retrying the request up to 3 times.
6.  **Given** a meeting UUID requires double-encoding (contains "//" or starts with "/"), **When** the tool makes an API call with that UUID, **Then** it correctly double-encodes the UUID in the URL path.
7.  **Given** a download is skipped due to permissions, **When** the tool finishes, **Then** it exits with a non-zero status code and provides a clear, actionable error message in the logs.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the API returns a 429 rate limit error? -> The tool must back off and retry up to 3 times.
- What happens if a file already exists in the target directory? -> The tool must skip the file unless an `--overwrite` flag is set.
- How does the system handle a download restricted by organization policy? -> It must surface a clear error and exit with a non-zero status code.
- How does the system handle meeting UUIDs that need special URL encoding? -> It must double-URL-encode them correctly.
- What happens if an invalid meeting ID or host email is provided? -> The tool should report that no recordings were found.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST fetch recordings within a user-specified time range, defaulting to the last 30 days.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow filtering recordings by an optional host filter (email), a meeting ID, or a meeting UUID.
