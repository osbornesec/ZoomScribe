# Draft PR: Clean-code refactor groundwork

## Plan of Work
1. Baseline & tooling foundations: create topic branch, capture current behavior, and extend project configuration for formatting, linting, typing, and shell tooling without behavior changes.
2. Domain model + configuration cleanup: introduce typed data models, centralized configuration handling, and supporting utilities with docstrings and strict typing.
3. HTTP client modernization: refactor Zoom API client around a reusable HTTP layer with retries, structured logging, explicit exceptions, and dependency injection.
4. Downloader hardening: implement atomic/idempotent file writes, bounded concurrency, resumable downloads, and TTY-aware progress logging.
5. CLI enhancements: preserve flags while adding logging controls, validation, and structured logging integration; ensure defaults remain unchanged.
6. Test expansion: add unit coverage for retries, atomic downloads, CLI parsing, and model parsing; maintain â‰¥85% coverage.
7. Documentation & CI: update README with new guidance, add Makefile, pre-commit, GitHub Actions, and finalize PR narrative including backward compatibility statement.

## Summary
- Added typed models (`Recording`, `RecordingFile`, `RecordingPage`) plus an OAuth configuration module with environment validation and masked logging helpers.
- Rebuilt the HTTP client with structured errors, retry/backoff, JSON logging, and dependency injection for session, clock, and sleeper utilities.
- Hardened the downloader with atomic `.part` writes, optional concurrency, detailed progress logging, and dry-run skip logic.
- Extended the CLI with `--log-level`/`--log-format`, path validation, improved logging configuration, and preserved existing flags/behaviour.
- Expanded test coverage for retry handling, atomic download semantics, CLI validation, and model parsing; added new tooling (Makefile, CI workflow, pre-commit) and refreshed README.

## Draft PR Checklist
- [x] ruff / black / isort / mypy / pytest pass locally (`make lint`, `.venv/bin/pytest -q`)
- [~] shellcheck + shfmt pass for shell scripts (skipped automatically when binaries are absent)
- [x] README documents installation, configuration, logging, troubleshooting
- [x] CLI flags and defaults remain backward compatible
